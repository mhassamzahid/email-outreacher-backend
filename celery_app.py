"""Celery: background work runs in worker processes, and Celery beat schedules it. Redis is the broker.

Run them next to the API (see README):
    celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info      (on Windows add --pool=solo)
    celery -A celery_app beat --loglevel=info        (exactly one beat, or checks are scheduled twice)

Beat starts the follow-up check every FOLLOWUP_CHECK_SECONDS (30 minutes by default).
