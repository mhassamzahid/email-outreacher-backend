"""Reads answered from memory: a page asking for what it asked for a moment ago gets it without a trip to the
database, which is the slow part (each round trip is hundreds of milliseconds from far away).

What's cached: successful JSON answers to GET requests under /api/v1, for RESPONSE_CACHE_SECONDS (60).
The key is the exact session token, workspace and URL, so an answer only ever goes back to the session
that got it, after the same frontend-secret and origin checks a request passes (dependencies.secret_refusal).

When it's cleared: every change made through Coldbrew (any request that isn't a read) and every finished
background job empties it, so nothing changed here shows stale. Changes made elsewhere (Lead Intel's own
app, the follow-up check in the worker) show within RESPONSE_CACHE_SECONDS. A request sent with
X-Coldbrew-Fresh (a page's Refresh) skips it. Each API process keeps its own; a change in one process
reaches another within RESPONSE_CACHE_SECONDS.
