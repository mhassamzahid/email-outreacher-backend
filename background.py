"""Long-running work runs in a Celery worker, never inside a web request.

Research, finding companies, fetching posts, writing emails, people searches and the like can take
minutes and call paid providers. The frontend starts them with POST /jobs (routers/jobs.py), which
records an eo_jobs row and queues `coldbrew.run_job`; the page then checks GET /jobs/{id} until it's
done. Calling one of these endpoints directly is refused (dependencies.refuse_inline).

The worker runs the very same endpoint, in-process, as the person who started the job: their role and
workspace access are checked exactly as in a request. `current_job` marks that call; it's a context
variable, so nothing outside the worker process can set it.

A job is never retried on its own (a retry could pay for the same work twice): one that dies with its
worker shows as failed and is started again by hand.
