"""Coldbrew's emails, sent through CheapSequencer's campaigns. Nothing here activates a campaign or
sends: a campaign only sends once a person activates it in CheapSequencer.

  queue       An approved first email goes into its ICP's campaign ("Coldbrew: <ICP>"): the lead is
              imported into a new list with email_1_subject and email_1_body, and the generic
              follow-ups in email_2_body and email_3_body (so a step can never go out blank), then
              the list is enrolled.
  follow-ups  Every run reads each campaign's enrollments. When a lead's next email is due within
              the lead time (last send + the step's delay) and they haven't replied, bounced or
              unsubscribed, Claude writes it with the follow-up prompt and it replaces the generic
              text. Nobody who already replied costs a follow-up.
  templates   The campaigns' step text: each lead's email, then the sender's name, company and
              physical address from Settings (US law asks for an address in commercial email).
