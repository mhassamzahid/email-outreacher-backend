"""Scoring a company against an ICP with Claude: how well it fits, 0 to 100, and why.

Only for companies found in Apollo (Lead Intel's are already verified). Claude reads what we
gathered (the website's text, the Instagram profile, Apollo's description) next to the ICP, using
the ICP's Company Verification prompt (or the workspace's default one), and answers in a fixed
JSON shape whatever the prompt says.

The prompt's model is used; Claude Haiku 5.5 (CLAUDE_SCORING_MODEL) when no prompt is given. Low
effort: this is classification. Temperature isn't sent (Haiku 5.5 rejects non-default sampling).
The SDK retries rate limits and server errors itself.
