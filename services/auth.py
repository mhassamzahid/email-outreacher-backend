"""Signing in: Supabase Auth issues the session, this checks it.

The frontend signs in with Supabase (email and password; there is no sign-up page, accounts are
made in the Supabase dashboard) and sends the session's access token as `Authorization: Bearer`.
Here the token's signature is checked against the project's public keys (ES256, fetched from its
JWKS endpoint and cached), along with who issued it, who it's for, and that it hasn't expired.

Supabase Auth is shared with Lead Intel, so any account there can sign in. What it may do here is
decided by our own `eo_users` row: its role and workspaces. That's separate from Lead Intel's roles.
