"""The follow-up check, as plain async code that a Celery task runs (see tasks.py and celery_app.py).

Each run looks at every workspace with emails queued in a CheapSequencer campaign: it records sends,
replies and stops, and writes the follow-ups that are nearly due. Nothing is kept between runs: each
one works out what's due from CheapSequencer and the database, so a late or skipped run loses nothing.
